## 👋 Hi, I'm Sander Põldma

I'm a full-stack developer and a computer science student currently finishing my bachelor's degree at the **University of Tartu**. 
I work part-time as a full-stack developer, where I build scalable and efficient applications using **Kotlin**, **Java**, **Angular**, **PostgreSQL**.

💻 I'm mostly interested in:
- Full-stack development
- Clean architecture and maintainable code
- API integrations and backend automation
- Exploring data science and machine learning when the opportunity arises
- Recently, I've also gotten interested in the **cybersecurity** world — I even participated in a **CTF competition**, which was a super fun and eye-opening experience (hoping to dive deeper into it soon!)

🎓 Finishing my BSc in Computer Science has given me a strong foundation in software engineering and a curiosity to dive deeper into complex systems.

🔭 I’m currently working on my BSc thesis — the codebase is public and can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/eba-method/eba-code/src/master/).
